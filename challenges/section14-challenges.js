// Coding Challenge 1

/*
Your tasks:
1. Use a constructor function to implement a 'Car'.A car has a 'make' and a;
'speed' property.The 'speed' property is the current speed of the car in
  km / h;
2. Implement an 'accelerate' method that will increase the car's speed by 10,
and log the new speed to the console;
3. Implement a 'brake' method that will decrease the car's speed by 5, and log
the new speed to the console;
4. Create 2 'Car' objects and experiment with calling 'accelerate' and;
'brake' multiple times on each of them
Test data:
ยง Data car 1: 'BMW' going at 120 km / h
ยง Data car 2: 'Mercedes' going at 95 km / h;

// Coding Challenge 2

/*
1. Re-create Challenge #1, but this time using an ES6 class (call it 'CarCl')
2. Add a getter called 'speedUS' which returns the current speed in mi/h (divide
by 1.6)
3. Add a setter called 'speedUS' which sets the current speed in mi/h (but
converts it to km/h before storing the value, by multiplying the input by 1.6)
4. Create a new car and experiment with the 'accelerate' and 'brake'
methods, and with the getter and setter.
Test data:
ยง Data car 1: 'Ford' going at 120 km/h
