// Coding Challenge 1

/*
We're building a football betting app (soccer for my American friends ðŸ˜…)!;;
Suppose we get data from a web service about a certain game('game' variable on
next page).In this challenge we're gonna work with that data.
Your tasks:
1. Create one player array for each team(variables 'players1' and
'players2')
2. The first player in any player array is the goalkeeper and the others are field;
players.For Bayern Munich(team 1) create one variable('gk') with the
goalkeeper's name, and one array ('fieldPlayers') with all the remaining 10
field players;
3. Create an array 'allPlayers' containing all players of both teams(22
players);
4. During the game, Bayern Munich(team 1) used 3 substitute players.So create a;
new array('players1Final') containing all the original team1 players plus;
'Thiago', 'Coutinho' and 'Perisic';
5. Based on the game.odds object, create one variable for each odd(called
'team1', 'draw' and 'team2')
6. Write a function ('printGoals') that receives an arbitrary number of player;
names(not an array) and prints each of them to the console, along with the
number of goals that were scored in total(number of player names passed in);
7. The team with the lower odd is more likely to win.Print to the console which
team is more likely to win, without using an if/else statement or the ternary
operator.
Test data for 6.: First, use players 'Davies', 'Muller', 'Lewandowski' and 'Kimmich'.
  Then, call the function again with players from game.scored
GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€

// Coding Challenge 2

/*
1. Loop over the game.scored array and print each player name to the console,
  along with the goal number(Example: "Goal 1: Lewandowski");
2. Use a loop to calculate the average odd and log it to the console(We already
studied how to calculate averages, you can go check if you don't remember);
3. Print the 3 odds to the console, but in a nice formatted way, exactly like this:
Odd of victory Bayern Munich: 1.33
Odd of draw: 3.25
Odd of victory Borrussia Dortmund: 6.5
Get the team names directly from the game object, don't hardcode them
  (except for "draw").Hint: Note how the odds and the game objects have the
same property names ðŸ˜‰
4. Bonus: Create an object called 'scorers' which contains the names of the
players who scored as properties, and the number of goals as the value.In this;
game, it will look like this:

{
  Gnarby: 1,
  Hummels: 1,
  Lewandowski: 2;
}
